Welcome to my developers' playground ;)
=========================================================================================================================

This is a little git repo for me to test out git features and to store little code snippets that might, 
or might not, be useful i some way. Don't expect me to fix bugs or something else, this is provides as is.

On the other hand, i'll use this as my github starting page, giving some info about myself and what i'm doing.




About Me
=========================================================================================================================

I'm a student of computer science at the university of dortmund currently working towards my bachelor.
Computer science has always been a hobby of mine, and now i'm hoping someday to earn my daily bread with it.
I'll include more information here when i see it fitting.


Java
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Java was my first programming language, and i still stick with it, although i have also some experience with C# and C++.
There are alway some projects around where i use java. My newest program is a little multiplayer sci-fi 
space flying game that i'm developing on top of jmonkeyengine (jME) and nifty GUI (sadly, nifty uses git, but on sf.net, 
and jme still is stuck with SVN ... brrr...). I have know almost 7 years of experience with java, and i have used many 
different aspects of the language. I'm firm with multiple GUI frameworks (AWT, Swing, SWT), i have quite e decent 
knowledge of java networking and JDBC and many other things. Well, it comes with the time i guess...


PHP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PHP was my second programming language (i don't count javascript as programming language), and i still do very much in 
PHP, although most of it (~90%) is based upon WoltLab Community Framework (WCF). I have roughly 4 years of experience 
wit PHP.


SQL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I wouldn't exactly call it my special area, but i have a decent knowledge of the aspects of SQL, since i use SQL 
databases both in PHP and Java applications.


XML & XPath
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

XML is a very good way to store and retrieve data, and i have quite some knowledge about XML. My XPath experience is 
somwhat limited, but i get around.


(X)HTML & CSS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have written many web applications, so i have quite a descent knowledge of (X)HTML and CSS. Nowadays, i'm always 
creating XHTML 1.1 valid websites, but i might switch to polyglot HTML5 sometimes.
